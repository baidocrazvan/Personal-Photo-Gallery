# 3D Personal Photo Album

A photo album gallery created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project showcases a visually interesting image gallery featuring photos from my personal collection, which I have physically printed and then scanned to turn them to digital. The main goal of the project is to be simple (minimal technologies used), visually unique, and to allow for effortless addition of new photos in the future.

## Known Issues

- **Image Pixelation**:
  - Images may pixelate after the animation runs. Using a combination of CSS properties and a timeout inside `index.js` to force image to re-render after each rotate seems to have fully resolved the issue. I have not encountered this anymore in my testing, but it might still happen to you depending on your browser.

- **Firefox Compatibility**:
  - The instax gallery does not display images correctly on Firefox. Images appear blurry and pixelated regardless of settings. I will try to find a solution for this problem.

- **Responsive design**:
  - The 3D animation is somewhat difficult to make "responsive" as it requires changing perspective and Z values in order to change its size. This led me down the rabbit-hole of creating many `@media` breakpoints in order to test different values. The CSS can be furthered cleaned and optimized.

## Future Improvements
  - Add a proper dark mode for the whole website.
  - Replace Bootstrap navbar with a custom one.
  - Fix image display issues on Firefox.
  - Clean up CSS.
  - Add "Video" gallery that supports playback, as I do own vintage camcorders that I want to share.

    - CSS (animations and transitions)
    - Javascript
